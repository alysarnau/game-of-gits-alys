House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
Somehow, due to his incredible integrity and strong chin, Ned Stark manages to make Cersei feel sorry for all the, uh, incest, and she voluntarily checks into Sociopath Rehab, a location that definitely exists.
The entire Stark family then goes on a beach vacation and everyone lives happily ever after, the end.
